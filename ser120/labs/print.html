<p>These lab assignments are meant to help you practice what you learn in SER120.
It's important to keep up with the lab practice so that you're prepared for
activities in the SER120 lecture, so make sure you complete and submit each lab
before the deadline listed on Blackboard.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lab-1-introduction-to-java--eclipse"><a class="header" href="#lab-1-introduction-to-java--eclipse">Lab 1: Introduction to Java &amp; Eclipse</a></h1>
<h2 id="objectives"><a class="header" href="#objectives">Objectives</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the Eclipse IDE to write, compile, and run Java programs</li>
<li>Write a basic &quot;Hello World&quot; program</li>
<li>Write Java code to perform a simple dialog-based interaction</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-0-start-eclipse"><a class="header" href="#task-0-start-eclipse">Task 0: Start Eclipse</a></h2>
<p>The Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a powerful tool
for editing, compiling, and running programs. It has many other
functionalities, but we will focus on the basics today. Let’s get
started.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find the Eclipse application on your computer and open it. If this
is your first time starting Eclipse, you might see a window similar
to the one shown below. Eclipse asks you to specify your workspace.
This is the folder where you will be saving all your Java programs.
Think about a good place (e.g. MyCourses/SER120/Programs).</p>
<p><img src="eclipse_intro/images/01_workspace.png" alt="image" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Browse to your folder for SER 120 programs (create one if you do not
have one yet), and then click the OK button. You will see the screen
shown below:</p>
<p><img src="eclipse_intro/images/02_welcome.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The welcome screen will appear for first-time users. If you mouse
over the bubbles, they will reveal various places you could go to
get more information. For now, just close the folder by clicking on
the X in the Welcome tab in the top-left part of the screen (just
above the Welcome to the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers message).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-java-perspective"><a class="header" href="#the-java-perspective">The Java Perspective</a></h3>
<p>Once you close the Welcome screen you will get to the <strong>Java
Perspective</strong> view. Maximize the application window. This is essentially
your home base for doing all your Java work. Think of Eclipse as a
carpenter’s workbench with all sorts of tools to support the carpenter’s
work. Except, that the carpenter is now a programmer and the tools are
software-based. Let’s spend some time getting familiar with the Java
Perspective/the workbench. Then we can write and run some programs.</p>
<p><img src="eclipse_intro/images/03_java_perspective.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Apart from the Menu options/icons, the default workbench area is divided
into 5 major views/sections (see above):</p>
<ol>
<li>Package Explorer: This will show your project files (each folder at
the top level typically represents a separate project)</li>
<li>Editor: This is where you edit/write code</li>
<li>Problems: This is where problems are reported. Also notice tabs for
Javadoc, Declaration, Diagrams, etc. We will visit these later.</li>
<li>Task List: TODO tasks listed here. You can close this. We will not
need this for some time.</li>
<li>Outline: This will show an outline of your code (to be used later).</li>
</ol>
<p>For now, just focus on the Menu options, the Package Explorer, and the
Editor panes. Note: If you accidentally close any of the windows and you
like to restore the java perspective, go to Window, then choose Reset
Perspective.</p>
<h2 id="task-1-new-java-project-and-hello-world"><a class="header" href="#task-1-new-java-project-and-hello-world">Task 1: New Java Project and Hello World</a></h2>
<p>To create a new project in Eclipse, from the File menu, select New and
then select Java Project (see below):</p>
<p><img src="eclipse_intro/images/04_new_project.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p><img src="eclipse_intro/images/05_project_dialog.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Every Java program you write in Eclipse will be part of a Project. After
you select the New Project option, you will get a pop up window (see
above). This is a form to fill out some details about the kind of
project you are creating.</p>
<p>Enter the name for your project in the &quot;Project name&quot; field. We have
chosen HelloWorld as you can see. Click Finish to accept the default
settings and create the project, now named HelloWorld.</p>
<p>You will notice that the HelloWorld project is now listed in the Project
Explorer view. Click on the little triangle to expose the contents of
the project as shown in the figure below. Eclipse created a folder
called HelloWorld in your specified workspace folder. In it, it has
placed another folder called src which is currently empty. &quot;src&quot; is
short for source code, and this is where the code for your program needs
to go.</p>
<p><img src="eclipse_intro/images/06_src.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p><img src="eclipse_intro/images/07_new_class.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>To write some Java code, we need to create a Java class (we will learn
about classes later). Select the File Menu again, followed by New, and
this time select &quot;Class&quot; (see above). Another form window will pop up as
shown in Figure 7.</p>
<p>Enter the name of the class (HelloWorld) in the Name field of the form.
The class name does not need to be the same as the project name; we just
chose to name the class so, because it will contain a little Hello World
program.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the little box against public static void
main(String[] args) is checked. Your form should match the image
below. Next, click Finish.</p>
<p><img src="eclipse_intro/images/08_class_form.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Eclipse has created, based on the information you provided in the
previous form, a template Java program for you. Now, delete the TODO
comment stub and add the System.out.println() command in the main()
method:</p>
<p><img src="eclipse_intro/images/09_template.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p><img src="eclipse_intro/images/10_hello_world.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<h3 id="program-execution"><a class="header" href="#program-execution">Program Execution</a></h3>
<p>Now you are ready to run the program. But first, be sure to Save the
program (from the File Menu select the Save option). From the Run Menu,
select the Run option (see the figure below).</p>
<p><img src="eclipse_intro/images/11_run.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Stuff happens. Very fast! If you focus on the Console view below the
Editor view, you will see the output of your program:</p>
<p><img src="eclipse_intro/images/12_hello_world.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Make some changes to the text that the program prints and run the
program a few more times. Also, notice the icon bar below the Menu Bar.
Many of the Menu items are available in that bar so you can just click
and go.</p>
<h2 id="task-2-dialog-based-hello-world"><a class="header" href="#task-2-dialog-based-hello-world">Task 2: Dialog-Based Hello World</a></h2>
<p>Create a new class called <code>HelloWorldDialog</code> and copy the
following code into the file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">/**
 * Edit this header comment to include your name and a description of this
 * class/program/assignment.
 */
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class HelloWorldDialog {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;Hello World!!!&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Run the program. This time the program should display a pop-up window
instead of printing to the console.</p>
<h2 id="task-3-dialog-based-interaction"><a class="header" href="#task-3-dialog-based-interaction">Task 3: Dialog-Based Interaction</a></h2>
<p>Create a new class called <code>GreetingDialog</code> and copy the
following code into the file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">/**
 * Edit this header comment to include your name and a description of this
 * class/program/assignment.
 */
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class GreetingDialog {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;);
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;Hello &quot; + name + &quot;!!!&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Run the program and see what happens!</p>
<h2 id="locating-your-code"><a class="header" href="#locating-your-code">Locating Your Code</a></h2>
<p>When you’ve finished with an assignment and want to submit your work,
you’ll need to find the .java files you wrote in Eclipse. These are
located in your workspace folder. You can check your workspace’s
location by clicking &quot;File&quot;, &quot;Switch Workspace&quot;, &quot;Other ...&quot;.</p>
<p>Each project has its own folder in your workspace, and you’ll find your
source code in the &quot;src&quot; folder (as discussed earlier) within the
project folder. Make sure you’re submitting the <strong>.java</strong> files, not the
.class files. The folders in src should all be .java files, but if you
accidentally look in the &quot;bin&quot; folder, you’ll see .class files with the
same names as your classes. The .class files are compiled code, and for
the most part they’re not human-readable. If you send me those instead
of your .java files, I won’t be able to read or (in many cases) run your
code.</p>
<h2 id="review--submission"><a class="header" href="#review--submission">Review &amp; Submission</a></h2>
<p>When you have completed the lab, please upload all Java source code and any
other documents (such as diagrams or answers to questions) to
Blackboard in a single submission. Make sure you have completed each task before
submitting the assignment.</p>
<p>I will review all lab assignments after the deadline. You should usually
receive feedback within a week of the deadline.</p>

whe entire Worm to change colors. The eyes should remain a different
color from the face and don’t have to be clickable, but otherwise
how the color change works is up to you (toggle between two or more
colors, switch between different patterns, etc.). You should make
the ClickableEllipse aware of the Worm instead of the Body, replace
the ellipses in the head, and add a setColor method to both the Head

<h2 id="task-2-make-the-worm-draggable"><a class="header" href="#task-2-make-the-worm-draggable">Task 2: Make the Worm Draggable</a></h2>

calling the body’s move method, call the worm’s move method.</li>
<li>Change your Worm and Body code to make sure that the Worm reference
is passed through the Body constructor to the DraggableEllipses.</li>
<li>Test your program: dragging any body segment should now drag the

<li>Modify the DraggableEllipse class so that instead of a reference to
the Body or Worm, it has a reference to a Movable. This Movable
object could be anything that implements the Movable interface: the
Head, Body, Worm, or even another DraggableEllipse.</li>
<li>To test this change out, make the Worm’s eyes only drag the head,
while everything else drags the entire worm. You hardly have to
change any code for this to happen: just give the eyes the head
(&quot;this&quot;) instead of the Worm. Note that the head will snap back
into place if you drag any other part of the worm.</li>

<p>Even the most well-written code changes over the years. The Color class

versions 1 through 1.3.</p>
<p>OpenJDK (Open Java Development Kit) is a free and open source
implementation of the Java programming language. The following webpage
is the implementation of Color.java in OpenJDK 8:

<ol>
<li>When was this Color class written?</li>
<li>Who are the author(s)?</li>
<li>What interface(s) does the Color class implement?</li>
<li>How many public instance variables are contained in the Color
class? What are the name(s) of these variables?</li>
<li>How many public static variables are contained in the Color
class? What are the name(s) of these variables?</li>
<li>How is the white color defined in Color class? What are the
modifiers used?</li>
<li>What are the RGB values for the color orange?</li>
<li>Go to the Java API for the Color class:
(<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html</a>).
Can you find any reference to the instance variable named
<code>falpha</code>? Find <code>falpha</code> in the <code>Color.java</code> code on OpenJDK. Does the
code tell you what the <code>falpha</code> variable does?</li>
<li>It seems like each color is defined twice (such as <code>RED</code> and <code>red</code>).
What version of Java implemented the uppercase name of the
color?</li>

<li>For this assignment you will be creating a UML diagram like the one
shown in the UML guide. In order to do this, we recommend
using the Violet UML editor. Violet has a very simple interface, and
makes it easy to create diagrams like the UMLGuide example. You
can download Violet at the following URL:
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/violet/files/violetumleditor/3.0.0/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/violet/files/violetumleditor/3.0.0/</a>.
Download the .jar file, which you should be able to run by
double-clicking as long as Java is installed on your computer. If it
warns you about needing Java 1.6, you probably downloaded the .exe
file instead of the .jar file.</li>
<li>One alternative to Violet is draw.io, a web application similar to
Google Docs. You can access it at <a href="https://www.draw.io">https://www.draw.io</a>. Be warned
that using draw.io instead of Violet will likely require a little
more work to follow the formatting conventions required in this
assignment.</li>

<h2 id="objectives-8"><a class="header" href="#objectives-8">Objectives</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a graphical application with Java’s Swing library</li>
<li>Display basic shapes using Swing</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lab-setup-5"><a class="header" href="#lab-setup-5">Lab Setup</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the starter code from Blackboard and add it to a new
Eclipse project. The starter code contains the following classes:
App, DrawingPanel, and SmartShape. The App class extends JFrame, and
the DrawingPanel class extends JPanel.</li>
<li>From this point on we’ll be using Swing instead of wheels, so you no
longer need to add wheels to your build path or extend any wheels
classes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="task-1-set-line-thickness"><a class="header" href="#task-1-set-line-thickness">Task 1: Set Line Thickness</a></h2>
<p>In wheels, we could easily get and set the line thickness of a
shape’s outline. Implement this feature in the SmartShape class:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a thickness integer instance variable to the SmartShape
class and write accessor/mutator methods for it.</li>
<li>To draw a shape with the given frame’s thickness, every time the
Graphics2D paintbrush is used to draw that shape, we need to set
the stroke of the paintbrush to the value of the thickness:</li>
<li>Create a new instance of java.awt.BasicStroke and pass
thickness as a parameter when calling the constructor.</li>
<li>Call the setStroke(...) method on the Graphics2D paintbrush
and pass the BasicStroke you just created as a parameter.</li>
<li>Call the setThickness method of rectangle in the DrawingPanel
constructor. Change the thickness to make sure your new feature
works.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="task-2-different-shapes"><a class="header" href="#task-2-different-shapes">Task 2: Different Shapes</a></h2>
<p>Try using the SmartShape class to display several different shapes:
a rectangle, rounded rectangle, and an ellipse. Display an instance
of each in the DrawingPanel to make sure they create the right
shape.</p>
<h2 id="task-3-composite-object"><a class="header" href="#task-3-composite-object">Task 3: Composite Object</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>When you were working with wheels, you created several different
objects composed of multiple wheels shapes (such as the worm from
lab 3).</li>
<li>Design your own object that can be represented with a few simple
shapes. You may find it helpful to sketch a picture and note the
sizes of each shape and its offset from an origin point (see the
tree demo from lab 3). You make whatever type of object you want as
long as it’s not something we’ve already made in a previous activity
or example.</li>
<li>Write a class for your object and give it the necessary SmartShape
components to display itself in your application. Your class should
have a draw method that takes a Graphics or Graphics2D and uses it
to draw each of its component shapes.</li>
<li>In your DrawingPanel class, make an instance of your new class and
call its draw method in paintComponent. Make sure your object is
displayed next to your other shapes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="task-4-set-location"><a class="header" href="#task-4-set-location">Task 4: Set Location</a></h2>
<p>Give your class a <code>setLocation</code> method. This should use relative
positioning with each of the component shapes, just like we did with
the worm.</p>

<h1 id="objectives-9"><a class="header" href="#objectives-9">Objectives</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Implement a button listener</li>
<li>Use a timer to animate a swing component</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="task-1-display-button-and-text"><a class="header" href="#task-1-display-button-and-text">Task 1: Display Button and Text</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Create an App class that extends JFrame and displays an empty
JPanel.</li>
<li>Add a JLabel with the text &quot;Go Bobcats!&quot; to your JPanel.</li>
<li>Add a JButton with the text &quot;Start&quot; to your JPanel.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="task-2-animate-text"><a class="header" href="#task-2-animate-text">Task 2: Animate Text</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Now you need to animate the JLabel. For this you will need a timer
to control the animation and a listener for the button.</li>
<li>Clicking on the button when its text reads &quot;Start&quot; should...
<ol>
<li>Change the button’s text to &quot;Stop&quot;.</li>
<li>Cause the label’s text to begin changing color. Every half
second, the color of the JLabel should change to a randomly
generated color.</li>
<li>To set the text color on a JLabel, use the setForeground method.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Clicking on the button when its text reads &quot;Stop&quot; should...
<ol>
<li>Change the button’s text to &quot;Start&quot;.</li>
<li>Cause the label to stop chaning colors. It should remain on the
current color rather than resetting.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Note: this task requires you to write TWO different action listener
classes! You should have one listener class for the timer, and a
different listener class for the button. Think about what has to
happen when you click the button (that’s the button listener’s job),
then compare that to what has to happen when the timer ticks down
(that’s the timer listener’s job).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="task-3-multiple-animations"><a class="header" href="#task-3-multiple-animations">Task 3: Multiple Animations</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Add a second timer that changes the number of exclamation points in
the &quot;Go Bobcats!&quot; message. It should cycle through &quot;Go Bobcats!&quot;,
&quot;Go Bobcats!!&quot;, and &quot;Go Bobcats!!!&quot; before returning to &quot;Go
Bobcats!&quot; and repeating this cycle.</li>
<li>You can use any interval you want here, but it must be different
from the interval used by your color timer. For example, if your
color timer triggers every 0.5 seconds, then this could trigger
every 0.75 seconds or every 1 second.</li>
<li>You should write a third action listener class for this task. The
action you are performing (changing the label’s text) is completely
different from the actions your other listeners perform, so this
should be a new action listener class. Don’t try to re-use the timer
or button listener from task 2.</li>

<li>Allow the SmartEllipse to be dragged with the mouse. This is very
similar to how you made draggable wheels shapes, so you may want to
take a look at the code from that lab.</li>
<li>You will need to implement two different listener interfaces (shown
above). Add an instance of each listener to the panel, not the
ellipse.</li>
<li>The ball should <strong>only</strong> be dragged when the mouse was pressed on
the ball, and it should not be possible to &quot;drop&quot; the ball by
dragging too fast.</li>
