<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="syllabus-revisions"><a class="header" href="#syllabus-revisions">Syllabus Revisions</a></h1>
<p>There are a few reasons that I may update this syllabus:</p>
<ul>
<li>A policy is not working as intended or a problem with the syllabus comes up
later in the semester. For example, if a project was due in the middle of the
semester and we had not covered the necessary topics before it was due.</li>
<li>I need to correct a mistake in the syllabus, such as a broken link or
inaccurate information about an assignment or policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the syllabus needs to be revised, then any changes will be noted here. I will
also keep older versions of the syllabus available on Blackboard so that there
is a clear record of all changes.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="communication-and-office-hours"><a class="header" href="#communication-and-office-hours">Communication and Office Hours</a></h1>
<h2 id="office-hours"><a class="header" href="#office-hours">Office Hours</a></h2>
<p>I am a part-time faculty member and do not have an office on campus, but I can
meet in person after my last CSC110 class ends at 3:15 on Tuesday/Thursday. You
can meet me in CCE 030 between 3:15 and 3:45, and if we need to stay later then
we can move to the modular unit on the second floor of CCE.</p>
<p>I normally end office hours once all students have left. Please send me an email
ahead of time if you plan to arrive after 3:30; otherwise, I may not still be
there when you show up.</p>
<p>We can also schedule a remote meeting on a different day if my in-person time
doesn't work for you. If you'd like to meet remotely, then please send me an
email with your availability over the next 2-3 days. I'll try to find a time
that works for both of us and schedule a Zoom meeting.</p>
<h2 id="blackboard"><a class="header" href="#blackboard">Blackboard</a></h2>
<p>I will post or link to all course material and assignments on Blackboard. If you
want to find something or submit an assignment, go to our Blackboard site and
look in the appropriate page. If you think I forgot to post something, then send
me an email and I'll either post it or tell you where to find it.</p>
<h2 id="email"><a class="header" href="#email">Email</a></h2>
<p>My email is <a href="mailto:zckohlberg@qu.edu">zckohlberg@qu.edu</a>. I check my email most weekdays and try to
respond to all emails within 24 hours. If you email me after Friday morning or
on the weekend, then I probably won't see it until Monday. You're still welcome
to email me at any time.</p>
<p>I will answer most questions via email if you don't want to ask in person. If
you're asking for help with an assignment, coding issue, or software, then
please attach your code (the text file, not a screenshot). Try to include as
much relevant information as possible and be specific about what you want to
know. This helps me give you a useful answer more quickly.</p>
<p>If you want me to do something more involved than answer a few questions, such
as review your code or help you debug a program, then you should meet with me
during office hours. I'm happy to help you with coding, debugging, and other
tasks as long as you're the one doing the task. You should not come to office
hours or send an email expecting me to do your work for you.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="course-material"><a class="header" href="#course-material">Course Material</a></h1>
<p>This lab is online and does not have any scheduled meetings. If you want to meet
with me, please see the office hours section in the previous page.</p>
<p>I plan to record one or more videos for most lab assignments to make up for the
lack of in-class instruction. These videos will usually cover an example related
to that week's lab activity.</p>
<h2 id="software"><a class="header" href="#software">Software</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text Editor/IDE</strong>: You should already be familiar with at least one editor
or IDE from your last programming class. I don't care which editor you use,
but I recommend <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse</a> or whichever
editor is used by your instructor in the lecture. If you use a different
editor, then make sure you can figure out on your own how to complete any
necessary tasks with that editor.</li>
<li><strong>Java</strong>: You should have Java installed from CSC110. If not, then please
install the JDK for a recent version of Java (as of 2024, Java 21 or 22
would be ideal).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">diagrams.net</a></strong>: This is a web app for creating
flowcharts and other diagrams. It can also integrate with Google Drive and
allow multiple people to edit the same diagram, but some students have
reported issues with lag while doing this.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-resources"><a class="header" href="#other-resources">Other Resources</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs//api/index.html">Java API</a>
is a useful reference. It may be intimidating right now, but the more you learn
about Java and programming in general, the more easily you'll be able to
navigate the API and use it to look up information.</p>
<p>Finally, asking good questions is one of the most useful skills you can have as
a student. In my experience, most people (myself included) don't ask questions
as often as they should, and it can be difficult to ask a question that will
quickly lead to a helpful answer. I think the blog posts below provide excellent
advice for asking and answering questions:</p>

<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/answer-questions-well/">https://jvns.ca/blog/answer-questions-well/</a></li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="assignments"><a class="header" href="#assignments">Assignments</a></h1>
<p>Most weeks we will have one new lab assignment. Directions, submission links,
and starter code (if applicable) for each lab will be posted or linked on
Blackboard.</p>
<h2 id="lab-grading"><a class="header" href="#lab-grading">Lab Grading</a></h2>
<p>Each lab assignment is worth 4 points. The <a href="./grading.html">grading</a> section
covers how these points determine your final grade.</p>
<p>You earn 3 out of these 4 points for completing the lab assignment. A lab
assignment is complete if:</p>
<ul>
<li>your work demonstrates a good-faith effort to complete each task given in the
assignment as directed; skipping any task means the lab is incomplete</li>
<li>you submit all source code (.java files, <strong>not</strong> .class files) and any other
material created for the assignment on Blackboard</li>
<li>the code you submitted compiles and runs (unless the assignment specifies
that it should not)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three ways to earn the fourth point:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your first submission demonstrates a correct implementation of each task with
no significant mistakes.</li>
<li>Submit a short reflection after receiving feedback that answers each question
in the feedback. These questions will usually point out mistakes in your work
and ask you about potential solutions to those mistakes.</li>
<li>Review the lab with me during an office hour meeting or a Zoom call. I will
discuss the feedback with you and help you correct any mistakes.</li>
</ol>
<p>I may place limits on how many reflections or lab reviews you can complete per
week towards the end of the semester so that I'm not flooded with too much work
to review or too many requests for meetings. You should try to finish these
within 1-2 weeks of receiving feedback if you want to ensure you are able to
earn full credit for each lab assignment.</p>
<h2 id="deadlines"><a class="header" href="#deadlines">Deadlines</a></h2>
<p>Labs submitted after their deadline will incur a late penalty:</p>
<ul>
<li>-1 point if submitted within 48 hours of the deadline</li>
<li>-2 points if submitted within one week of the deadline</li>
<li>-3 points if submitted more than one week after the deadline but before finals
week</li>
</ul>
<p>This syllabus was not posted at the beginning of the semester due to the change
in instructor. There will be a grace period (announced on Blackboard with the
syllabus) during which you can submit late work at a penalty of -1 point
regardless of how late it is.</p>
<p>My reasons for these restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lab assignments are meant to help you practice and prepare for what you're
doing in the lecture. Late work in the lab negatively impacts the lecture and
is therefore penalized. Waiting even longer makes the lab assignment less
useful as practice and is therefore penalized more harshly.</li>
<li>Lab assignments take time for me to review, and I need to spread this review
workload out so that I can keep up with other work. The late penalties
incentivize you to turn in work on time.</li>
<li>I give specific times and enforce deadlines strictly to ensure I handle
assignment submissions consistently and fairly. It doesn't matter how close
you are to a missed deadline or what excuse you offer. You either submit the
assignment on time or arrange for an extension (see below); otherwise, the
assignment is late.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="extensions-and-other-exceptions"><a class="header" href="#extensions-and-other-exceptions">Extensions and Other Exceptions</a></h2>
<p>In rare cases (such as medical or family emergencies), I will allow an extension
to a deadline or an exception to another restriction on submitting an
assignment. You can email me to ask for a such an exception if you believe one
is appropriate in your situation. Your email should include an explanation of
why you need the extension, a new proposed deadline (or other proposed change to
existing restrictions), and your current progress on the assignment. Be sure to
send me your code and any other material you've created for the assignment so
far.</p>
<p>I have some expectations if I am going to give an extension or make an exception
to a class policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>You've demonstrated that you read this policy by including <em>all</em> of the
information I just asked for.</li>
<li>If you're having trouble with the assignment, then you're taking steps to get
help. Usually this means seeing a tutor or going to office hours.</li>
<li>You are clearly making an effort to keep up with the class and not
procrastinating. If there is an ongoing problem affecting your work or
participation in the class and you want me to accommodate you, then you must
let me know early and keep me informed as that situation develops.</li>
</ul>
<p>Extensions and other exceptions are given on a case-by-case basis. I will try to
be as fair as possible, but this comes down to my judgement and whether you've
been proactively communicating with me.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="grading"><a class="header" href="#grading">Grading</a></h1>

<p>These points are based on the total number of lab assignments. If I need to cut
a planned assignment, then the table will be adjusted to reflect the new total.
This adjustment will <strong>lower</strong> the point threshold for some grades. This system
is equivalent to averaging the scores for all lab assignments, but I think
presenting it this way makes it easier to understand how close you are to
earning any given final grade.</p>

<p>This section covers some resources available to you at Quinnipiac University.
Please don't hesitate to ask me, your advisor, or an academic coach if you need
help finding or accessing a resource. If I'm not able to help you directly, then
I'll try to put you in touch with someone who can.</p>
<h2 id="academic-catalog"><a class="header" href="#academic-catalog">Academic Catalog</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/">Academic Catalog</a> includes the

<h2 id="learning-commons"><a class="header" href="#learning-commons">Learning Commons</a></h2>
<p>I highly recommend making use of the Learning Commons any time you need help
with work for this class. There should be several peer tutors available for
computer science and software engineering courses. The Learning Commons also
employs academic coaches who work with first-year students.</p>
<p>Below is some additional information about the Learning Commons and their
contact information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Learning Commons is a place for students to go when they want to achieve a
level of performance they can’t reach on their own. In a setting of practice
and growth, student resources are provided through Peer Educator programs, the
Office of Student Accessibility, and Academic Development &amp; Outreach
professional staff. The Learning Commons can be found at the Mount Carmel
Campus in the North wing of the Arnold Bernhard Library; and at the North
Haven Campus on the third floor of the Law School (SLE-340). Students are
encouraged to visit The Learning Commons for support with class content, to
improve study skills, to consult on academic success strategies, and for
general developmental advising needs.</p>

<h2 id="accommodations"><a class="header" href="#accommodations">Accommodations</a></h2>
<p>QU's policy on disabilities and accommodations can be found at
<a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/university-policies/disability-policy/">https://catalog.qu.edu/university-policies/disability-policy/</a>.</p>
<p>This is a statement about accommodations and disabilities that the university
recommends including in all syllabi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quinnipiac University is committed to creating a learning environment that
meets the needs of its diverse student body. If you anticipate or experience
any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your
concerns with me.</p>
<p>If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you may also
want to meet with the Office of Student Accessibility, to begin this
conversation or to request reasonable accommodations. Quinnipiac University
complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</p>
<p>Please contact the Office of Student Accessibility by emailing access@qu.edu,
or by calling 203-582-7600. If you have already been approved for
accommodations through the Office of Student Accessibility, please meet with
me so we can develop an implementation plan together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, I want to add that your mental and physical health are more important
than your classes. If you're struggling with class due to mental health issues
or notice that you're developing unhealthy habits to cope with your workload,
then please talk to someone as early as possible. I'll try to work with you if
you tell me about a problem you're experiencing, and the earlier we talk the
more I can do to help you.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="academic-integrity-ai-policy"><a class="header" href="#academic-integrity-ai-policy">Academic Integrity (AI) Policy</a></h1>
<p>Here is a link to Quinnipiac University's Academic Integrity (AI) policy:
<a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/university-policies/academic-integrity-policy/">https://catalog.qu.edu/university-policies/academic-integrity-policy/</a>. This
policy applies to all courses at QU, and this part of the syllabus goes into
detail about how the AI policy works in our class. From this point forward I
will assume you are familiar with the school's AI policy.</p>
<h2 id="permission-to-discuss-work"><a class="header" href="#permission-to-discuss-work">Permission to Discuss Work</a></h2>
<p>I consider it important that you can freely discuss assignments with other
students. Your peers can be an excellent source of help and feedback, and your
own insights and feedback can greatly help other students. I don't want the
school's or my AI policies to discourage you from talking to anyone else about
your work. Therefore, this section serves as my explicit written permission to
do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may discuss assignments from this class with anybody.</li>
<li>You may ask anybody for help with these assignments, including your
classmates, but you may not view their solutions to the assignment. You must
still complete all the work yourself.</li>
<li>You may share your work with a person who is helping you with an assignment so
that they can give you feedback. This person must not be a classmate who has
yet to complete the assignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I want to clarify that this permission does not extend to any of the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may <strong>NOT</strong> share your work except as noted above, and you may not post it
online for any reason. This lab uses assignments that other instructors
designed and regularly use when they teach the lab, and it is not my place to
give you permission to share solutions to their assignments.</li>
<li>You may not complete the assignment with a partner or a group unless you
receive my permission to work in a group on the assignment. All labs must be
entirely your own work, even if you discussed the assignment with or received
assistance from a classmate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-counts-as-plagiarism"><a class="header" href="#what-counts-as-plagiarism">What Counts as Plagiarism?</a></h2>
<p>First and most important: <strong>in any situation where you have doubts or are unsure
whether an action would violate this policy, ask me!</strong> It's always okay to ask
whether you <em>can</em> do something.</p>
<p>This section exists for two reasons: to make it easier for someone who has
genuine questions to determine whether an action qualifies as cheating, and to
give me something to point to if somebody claims they didn't know their actions
qualified as cheating. Going through a series of flimsy excuses is one of the
most tedious parts of handling an AI violation, so I'd like to be thorough here
and save myself some trouble later.</p>
<p>This will focus on plagiarism on programming assignments. I'll use the phrase
&quot;<strong>other work</strong>&quot; to refer to any work that was created by somebody other than
you or by an LLM (such as ChatGPT). The following actions will nearly always
violate the AI policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying <strong>other work</strong> in whole or in part, whether by copying the file,
copying and pasting the file's contents, or viewing the file and retyping the
same information by hand. Modifying <strong>other work</strong> after copying it, whether
to disguise the copying or &quot;make it your own&quot; (an excuse I've heard
frequently) does not change the fact that it was copied. What matters is that
you copied work, not how you copied it or what you did before or after copying
it.</li>
<li>Paraphrasing <strong>other work</strong> in whole or in part. As far as I'm concerned, this
is the same as copying. In my experience, some paraphrasing is often used to
disguise that work was copied, and the claim that work was paraphrased is used
as an excuse to deny having copied work.</li>
<li>Using <strong>other work</strong> as a reference when creating your own work. This normally
results in copying or paraphrasing as described above, but I mention it
because it's another common excuse used to explain evidence of copying.</li>
<li>Doing your work under the direction of another person. It's okay to talk to
someone about your work while you're working, but it's not okay to let them
dictate the code to you. If you're mostly writing what someone else tells you
to write, then you are not doing your own work. Try talking to them about your
problem, taking some notes, and then fixing the problem on your own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exceptions to the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use material that I intentionally provide you (such as my notes,
starter code, assignment descriptions, or examples from class) with or without
modification in your own work for this class. You don't need to document your
use of such material because it is expected and obvious from context.</li>
<li>If you want to copy or paraphrase from another source, then you can as long as
you do the following:
<ul>
<li>Discuss it with me first and get my permission to use the other work on the
assignment.</li>
<li>Clearly state which outside sources you used and provide a reliable link or
other means to access those sources.</li>
<li>Clearly show what was taken from the other source and what is your own
original work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Two general rules I use if someone appears to have plagiarized but claims they
did not:</p>
<ul>
<li>If large sections of your code are identical or nearly identical to existing
code, then it isn't your work. If you are writing your own code and following
the guidelines I provide in this policy, then you should always end up with
significantly different code on all but the simplest programs.</li>
<li>If you don't understand your code and cannot explain how it works, then it
isn't your work. You should not be using code that you don't understand, and
you are not going to accidentally write a working program that solves a
specific problem without some understanding of the code you're writing. If
your code doesn't appear to be something a student realistically would have
written and you cannot explain how it works, then I will not accept it for an
assignment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="retaking-this-class-and-self-plagiarism"><a class="header" href="#retaking-this-class-and-self-plagiarism">Retaking this Class and Self-Plagiarism</a></h3>
<p>If you are retaking this class, then I expect you to complete every assignment
from scratch without reusing any of your old work. I consider reusing work from
the last time you took this class equivalent to reusing work you completed for a
different class (&quot;double-dipping&quot; in QU's AI policy).</p>
<h2 id="chatgpt-and-llms"><a class="header" href="#chatgpt-and-llms">ChatGPT and LLMs</a></h2>
<p>You're free to discuss assignments with LLMs such as ChatGPT, but I do not
recommend using them for this class. While we might colloquially refer to an LLM
as an &quot;artificial intelligence,&quot; these tools are not intelligent and do not
understand the conversation they are having with you. They are complex
algorithms running on powerful hardware, and they are very good at one thing:
using their training data to produce text that looks like something a human
might write in the context of your conversation. LLMs are prone to hallucinating
(making up false information), and they do not know when they are hallucinating.
These tools are most useful in the hands of an expert who can critically
evaluate the information generated by an LLM. You are most likely not an expert
at this point.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, I treat material generated by an LLM the same as material
created by another person for the purpose of this AI policy. It is not your
work, and using this material in an assignment violates this policy.</p>
<p>If you are using ChatGPT for help with an assignment, then please save that
conversation so you can share it with me or the AI Office if your work is called
into question. This is an easy way to establish whether you used the tool
appropriately, and if you cannot or will not provide that evidence then I will
not give you the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<h2 id="consequences-for-ai-violations"><a class="header" href="#consequences-for-ai-violations">Consequences for AI Violations</a></h2>
<p>Consequences for AI violations are determined either by joint resolution, case
review, or a hearing. In a joint resolution, you and I must agree to any
proposed consequences, and in a case review or hearing I will still be consulted
about appropriate consequences. This section covers what I believe are
appropriate consequences <em>on a first offense</em> for most AI violations.</p>
<p>If you plagiarize, cheat, or otherwise violate the AI policy on an assignment,
then under no circumstances will I consider it appropriate to give you credit
for the assignment. This is <strong>not</strong> a punishment for cheating, it is simply
enforcing the requirements of the grading system. If you copied or cheated on
even a small portion of the assignment, <strong>then you did not complete the entire
assignment</strong>; you completed <em>some</em> of the assignment and then copied the
remaining work. To give any credit, full or partial, would be a reward for
cheating.</p>
<p>In addition to enforcing the normal penalty for incomplete work, I consider the
following consequences to be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you cheat on one assignment, then your final grade should be reduced by one
letter grade after accounting for the incomplete assignment. I will not allow
you to redo the assignment.</li>
<li>If you cheat on multiple assignments, then you should receive a final grade of
F. Depending on the extent or nature of this cheating (for example, if you
cheat on more than two assignments), further penalties may be appropriate.</li>
</ul>
